In today's fast-paced and competitive taxi industry, the ability to make informed decisions based on accurate data is more important than ever. The vast amount of data generated by taxi operations can be overwhelming and difficult to interpret without the right tools. Our project aims to address this challenge by creating a forecast model displayed on an interactive dashboard that leverages Tableau's powerful data visualization capabilities.
